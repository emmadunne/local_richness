Patches of plant detritus may include conifer twigs and leaves up to 30 cm long. Conchostracan shells, sometimes with closed valves, are very common in this layer. Almost all specimens of the crablike giant cycloid crustaceans come from it as well as a few elytra of beetles. The lower half of the unit is gray, the upper variegated, tending to be dark reddish near the top. Near the boundary between the gray and reddish parts of the unit, calcareous concretions and lenses of grainstone with skulls and partially articulated skeletons occur in abundance.

Skulls and bones of the phytosaur Paleorhinus are less common. Both are apparently the members of the local lacustrine community. Specimens of the capitosaurid temnospondyl Cyclotosaurus are third in number among large, easily recognizable tetrapods. It was probably a predatory amphibious animal living near the lake shore. However, typical terrestrial tetrapod remains are also represented in the lacustrine horizon. Usually these are isolated bones, but accumulations of disarticulated bones suggestive of decaying cadavers transported to the lake, deposited at its bottom and decomposed there, are common. Partially articulated skeletons have been also found. Articulated caudal armor plates of the aetosaur Stagonolepis and almost complete skeleton of the dinosaur Silesaurus are among them...Dark coloration of the sediment in the lower half of the lacustrine bed and dispersed pyrite grains (usually oxidised) indicate anoxic conditions in the sediment.

Specimens from the concretions are threedimensionally preserved; however, the concretion may cover only a part of the whole element. Partial skulls are not uncommon. In contrast, the specimens found in the clay usually are crushed and deformed. The skull bones may be separated along the sutures and loose parts of the skull are then slightly displaced. Isolated skull bones with wellpreserved sutured margins are rare. Postcranial bones are usually disarticulated. Elements of the vertebral column or limbs have been rarely found in association. The Metoposaurus specimens from the lower horizon were deposited probably on the bottom of a lake as partially decayed cadavers. This is suggested by the common association of skulls with mandibles and bones of the pectoral girdle. Winnowing was frequent and many disarticulated bones occur in lenticular intercalations of calcareous grainstone. The clavicles usually occur with their convex side down, indicating deposition from suspension.

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying “upper siltstone” member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones. The conglomerates are poorly sorted, range in color from brown to yellow and are dominated by intraformational carbonate clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common. The conglomerates alternate with finer layers of green to pale grey mudstone and siltstone that often include root traces and other organics, but do not show any large-scale evidence of oxidation.""",conglomerate,"gypsiferous,intraclastic,brown,yellow",,sandy,Y,siltstone,"gray,green",,,,coarse channel fill,,"""repeated transient flooding events concentrated vertebrate (bones, carcasses, live animals) and plant material from the landscape surface, possibly in hyperconcentrated flows. These events were separated by periods of standing water and weakly-developed, poorly-drained (hydromorphic) soil formation. The hydromorphic nature of the paleosols is evidenced by the drab matrix colorations, abundance of yellow-brown (goethite) mottles, preservation of organic matter, including local leaf litter, predominance of goethite rhizocretions, and general dearth of other redoximorphic features. The high density of channel deposits incised into overbank sediments in the Petrified Forest Member indicate that avulsions were common on the Late Triassic landscape of the Chama Basin, and therefore that the Petrified Forest Member fluvial systems were unstable in this area. This large-scale instability in the local base level and resulting incision has also been reported for the Petrified Forest Member in northern Arizona""",macrofossils,,,,,,,,body,good,,,concentrate,concentrated,,,,occasional,,,,taxonomic,"selective quarrying,mechanical,field collection",,,,,"Irmis, Nesbitt, Turner, et. al.",2006-,,

Immediately below the specimen, the sediment shows conspicuous bioturbation. The sediment encasing the pterosaur is a dark grey limestone. The sedimentary unit (12 cm thick) including the fossil can be divided into three main parts (Fig. 4): 1) Basal most part (3 cm thick): a micritic limestone with less fossil shells than seen elsewhere; the base is erosional with scour-and-fill-structures; 2) Middle part (5 cm): the matrix is micritic and contains many ooids, and shells (mostly convex side up) and shell fragments; lamellibranchs with both shells preserved are rare; the ooids often have fragments of bivalves and gastropods as nuclei; towards the upper part the\r\nooids show a decrease in grain size, indicating a small scale fining upward sequence; 3) Upper part (4 cm): this micritic part is the matrix of the pterosaur, it shows marly laminated intercalations; the ooid content decreases gradually, they are missing in the uppermost part; the last part of the slab is built up by laminated, yellow, calcareous marl; the latter yields thin shell\r\nfragments and rare ganoid scales.

The layer including the pterosaur is interpreted as a storm deposit, a tempestite that was subsequently bioturbated (presence of Thalassinoides). The increased marl content, the complete absence of ooids in the uppermost part and the clay layer indicate laminar, non-turbulent lower energy conditions.

Amongst these occur a few beds of conglomerate, which fairly may be termed bone beds, as they consist, besides boulders and pebbles of light-coloured slates, of great quantities of well-rounded pieces of bones and broken shells. The former often show considerable dimensions. I was thus able to measure the proximal end of, probably, a humerus, which I found to be 8 inches across, and some other bones of similar dimensions. However, the bones, as before observed, were so much rolled, and the cementing medium of such considerable hardness, that I was unable, with the tools at my command, to procure any characteristic specimens, but I have no doubt that they are of Saurian origin.

In 2002, we acquired samples of a tuffaceous sandstone at the base of the Blue Mesa Member locally and had the detrital zircons analysed by U-Pb geochronology, but were unable to report results until Heckert et al. (2009). Other workers have also obtained age estimates for this horizon, including Irmis and Mundil (2008) and Irmis et al. (2011) Despite using three different techniques, each at different laboratories, all have estimated an age of approximately 220 Ma (Table 1). As a detrital zircon estimate, this is by definition a maximum age, and the dated horizon is approximately 43 m above the Doswellia occurrence, so it is possible that the site is as much as several million years older than 220 Ma. However, given the rarity of Late Triassic age constraints associated with biostratigraphically useful tetrapods, c. 220 Ma is a reasonable approximation for the numerical age of the D. sixmilensis type locality, although it is several million years younger than the age estimates of homotaxial strata recently published by Ramezani et al. (2011)."" \r\n\r\nAlthough Heckert et al (2012) argue that an age of 220 Ma places this locality in the Carnian, most recent work and recent geological timescales use an age of approximately 228 Ma for the Carnian/Norian boundary (e.g. International Committee on Stratigraphy, 2012) and so the locality is entered here as Norian.
